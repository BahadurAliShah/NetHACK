Network Packet Analyzer is a powerful tool designed for comprehensive network traffic analysis. It captures and analyzes network packets in real-time, providing users with deep insights into network behavior. Ideal for network administrators, security professionals, and developers, this tool aids in troubleshooting network issues, monitoring performance, and enhancing network security. By dissecting network packets, users can understand network protocols, identify bottlenecks, detect security anomalies, and visualize data flow. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with Suricata for advanced threat detection and supports capturing packets from nearby networks using monitoring mode. The tool also allows users to import and export packet capture files for collaborative analysis and record-keeping.

# Features:
## Real-time Packet Capture: 
Captures network packets in real-time for immediate network activity monitoring.
## Packet Dissection: 
Breaks down captured packets to reveal detailed information about network protocols, addresses, ports, and data payload.
## Protocol Analysis: 
Supports a wide range of network protocols (TCP, UDP, IP, HTTP, DNS, etc.) for in-depth communication analysis across network layers.
## Filtering and Search: 
Allows users to efficiently analyze traffic by filtering packets based on specific criteria and searching for packets of interest.
## Statistics and Summaries: 
Provides statistical overviews of network traffic, including packet counts, protocol distribution, and bandwidth usage, for performance assessment.
## User-Friendly Interface: 
Features an intuitive graphical interface for easy packet capture, analysis, and data interpretation.
## Suricata Integration: 
Built-in integration with Suricata, a powerful intrusion detection system, to generate warnings and alerts based on detected network anomalies and potential threats.
## Import/Export Files:
Users can import and export packet capture files in standard formats (e.g., PCAP) for further analysis in other tools or for sharing and archival purposes.
## Nearby Network Capture (Monitoring Mode): 
**Leverages the monitoring mode of network adapters to capture packets from all nearby networks, not just the network the user is directly connected to, providing a broader network visibility.**
